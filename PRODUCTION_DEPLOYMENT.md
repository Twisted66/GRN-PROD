# üöÄ Production Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Security Hardening ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **RLS Policies Fixed**: Replaced vulnerable `auth.role()` with secure user table queries
- [x] **IDOR Protection**: Added authorization checks in all Netlify functions
- [x] **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schemas with sanitization
- [x] **File Upload Security**: Size limits, type validation, and path sanitization

### 2. Error Handling & Monitoring ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Centralized Error Handling**: ErrorProvider context with toast notifications
- [x] **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries for graceful failure
- [x] **Sentry Integration**: Production error tracking and monitoring
- [x] **Health Checks**: `/api/health` endpoint for service monitoring

### 3. Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Unit Tests**: Validation schemas and error handling
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Authentication utilities and API helpers
- [x] **Test Coverage**: 70% minimum coverage threshold
- [x] **CI/CD Ready**: Test scripts for automated deployment

## üîß Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Set these in your production environment:

```bash
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_production_service_key

# Optional but Recommended
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
NODE_ENV=production
WEBSITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### 2. Database Migration
```bash
# Deploy security fixes to production
npx supabase db push --linked

# Verify RLS policies are active
npx supabase db remote --linked
```

### 3. Build & Test
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:ci

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run start
```

### 4. Health Check Verification
After deployment, verify these endpoints:
- `GET /api/health` - Overall system health
- `HEAD /api/health` - Simple liveness probe

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-12T...",
  "services": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "auth": "healthy", 
    "storage": "healthy"
  }
}
```

## üîê Security Verification

### Critical Security Checks
1. **RLS Policies**: Verify no `auth.role()` usage in production
2. **Function Authorization**: Test API endpoints reject unauthorized access
3. **Input Validation**: Confirm all forms validate and sanitize input
4. **File Uploads**: Verify size limits and type restrictions work

### Security Testing Commands
```bash
# Test unauthorized access (should fail)
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/.netlify/functions/upload-po-document

# Test with invalid data (should return validation errors)
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/.netlify/functions/process-return \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"invalid": "data"}'
```

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### Error Tracking
- **Sentry**: Configured for production error tracking
- **Error Logs**: Available via `/api/log-error` endpoint
- **Health Monitoring**: Use `/api/health` for uptime monitoring

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor response times for API endpoints
- Track error rates and user experience
- Set up alerts for service degradation

## üß™ Testing in Production

### Post-Deployment Tests
1. **Authentication Flow**: Test login/logout/registration
2. **CRUD Operations**: Test create/read/update/delete for all entities
3. **File Upload**: Test document upload functionality
4. **Report Generation**: Test PDF generation
5. **Error Handling**: Verify user-friendly error messages

### Rollback Plan
If issues are detected:
1. **Database**: Rollback migration if needed
2. **Application**: Deploy previous version
3. **Environment**: Restore previous environment variables
4. **Monitoring**: Check health endpoints recover

## üìã Production Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor error rates in Sentry
- Review security logs for suspicious activity
- Update dependencies for security patches
- Run database maintenance and optimize queries

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor API response times
- Optimize database queries with slow response
- Review and update caching strategies
- Monitor storage usage and cleanup old files
